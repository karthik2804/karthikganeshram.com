Hi! I’m Karthik, a software engineer originally from the city of Chennai in India. I moved to the US for my masters degree in computer engineering at UC Davis. I currently live in the Netherlands.

When I’m not immersed in work or studying, I enjoy listening to music — especially rock, though I appreciate a wide range of styles — and gaming to unwind. Occasionally, I pick up my camera and try my hand at photography — you can see some of my snapshots on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/karthik_ganeshram/).

Biking is another hobby close to my heart. It started as a pastime during my M.S. degree at UC Davis and has since become a wonderful way for me to explore new places and clear my mind.

I also love hiking and am currently exploring Europe while living in the Netherlands. I really enjoyed hiking in Madeira — the landscapes were breathtaking. So far, I’ve been fortunate to visit Portugal, Spain, Belgium, France, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Germany, and I’m excited to discover even more of this incredible region. For me, traveling is all about experiencing new cultures, tasting local cuisines, and connecting with nature.

I’m also a big fan of good coffee — nothing quite like a great cup to fuel creativity and reflection.

I’m an avid reader, especially drawn to philosophy, self-improvement, and biographies. Books help me gain new perspectives and continually expand my understanding of the world and myself.
