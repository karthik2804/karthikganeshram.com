I was born into a wonderful family in Chennai, a city in South India. And this blog is all about how I got to where I am today, where I am going from here and the journey in between. It will have tech, some thoughts about the last book I read, and a lot of musings about philosophy.

My fascination with computers and programming began, as might be the case for many of you, with “Hello World.” Typing out the program and seeing the words appear on the screen gave me a feeling of satisfaction that I can still remember. Begining there my life has taken me through a journey towards finding my interests in computer architecutre and parallel processing. Apart from it, I enjoy web development. With a healthy mix of hard work and luck, I was able to get into UC Davis and where I hope to do what I love the most - understanding computers in depth.

My first memories of videogames are those of me playing Age of Empires on my PC after school while my cousin sat with me and cheered me on. I play the game even today. Well, that and any outdoor sport. I enjoy reading and discussing various viewpoints in life.

And you might be wondering why my blog is anything different from the hundreds of others. It isn’t! It is just a way for me document my journey towards a better personal and professional life. If my journey and experience helps you somehow, that is an added plus!

Until next time, stay safe and healthy!
