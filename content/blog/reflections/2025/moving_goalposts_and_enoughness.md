I have learned something about myself over the years. Whenever I reach a goal, I celebrate, but I also tend to move on quickly. Historically, my celebrations were short lived bursts of joy. Bright, enthusiastic, and gone almost before I had time to look around and appreciate what I had actually done.

My happiness has always been genuine. It often involves a pastry, which is probably the most reliable reward system I have ever invented. I sit there with something sweet and comforting, enjoy the moment fully, and feel proud of myself. But by the time I am brushing off the last crumbs, my mind is already getting restless. It starts looking for the next mountain, the next idea, the next challenge. Apparently I have an inner endurance athlete who believes recovery time should be optional.

Because of that, my life has often felt a bit like completing a long, tough hike, finally reaching the summit, taking one victorious photo, and then immediately checking the map to see what other trails I can do before the sun sets. I do not skip the accomplishment, but I definitely do not linger either. I go from summit to summit at a pace that surprises even me sometimes.

Recently I have tried something different. I am making a conscious effort to let success settle in. I stay with the feeling of achievement longer. I savor the pastry instead of inhaling it. I let myself sit at the summit before rushing down the trail to find a new challenge.

And the surprising part is how much lighter everything feels.

With fewer self imposed deadlines swirling in my head, I have noticed a level of calm that used to feel out of reach. Without the constant pressure to chase the next big thing, I enjoy my days more. I feel more grounded and more present. It is as if my mind finally set down a heavy backpack it did not need to carry. The weight of the endless push forward has eased.

Giving myself permission to pause has made a real difference in my mental health. I feel more balanced. I feel more able to appreciate small joys. I feel more connected to my own life instead of racing through it. The pauses have not slowed my ambition. They have simply made it more sustainable.

I still love new goals. I still get excited about fresh possibilities. That part of me is alive and well. It is just no longer running the entire show. It has learned to wait while I enjoy the view at the top. It has learned that rest is not the enemy of progress. It is part of it.

So here I am, taking longer celebrations, eating pastries at a normal pace, and allowing myself to stay in the moment. The next goal will be there when I am ready. For now, it feels good to breathe a little more and push a little less.

And yes, the pastries taste even better this way!
