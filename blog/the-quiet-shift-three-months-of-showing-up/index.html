It was one of those things that lived in the background, always there, always “something I should start doing.” I’d get a little momentum, then drop it. The intention was always there, the follow-through wasn’t.</p><p>I used to stay up way too late, usually around 1 or 2 a.m., and wake up at 8:30 or 9 still feeling tired and scattered. I didn’t feel terrible, but I didn’t feel great either. Just a constant sense that I wasn’t really operating at my best - not mentally, not physically, not in how I structured my time.</p><p>Things started to shift in March. I was on a trip to Portugal and spent some time hiking in Madeira. It was a beautiful place, and I really enjoyed the hikes — but I could also feel how out of shape I was. I managed fine, but part of me knew I should be feeling stronger than I did. That trip stuck with me, and when I got home, I decided I wanted to change a few things, not because I hit rock bottom or anything dramatic, but because I finally felt ready to prove to myself that I could stick with something and see it through.</p><p>I started going to gym regularly to begin with. Then I signed up for a trial session with a personal trainer mainly because it was free, and honestly, I didn’t expect much. But once I got there, things felt different. About halfway through, I half joked and half seriously said, “I think I might cry if you increase the weight again.” Without missing a beat, she replied, “You can cry, sure, but you are still doing it.” That moment made me realize we would probably work well together.</p><p>I do push myself sometimes, but I also tend to slip into my comfort zone more often than I’d like. Having someone who encourages me and keeps things challenging—but not overwhelming—has made a big difference. She pushes me, checks in regularly, and keeps me moving forward. This balance of structure and support has really helped me stay focused and committed.</p><p>Since then, I’ve built a routine that actually works. I wake up at 6 a.m. now, which felt impossible not that long ago. I go to the gym five times a week, mainly strength training. I’ve lost around 6kg and feel noticeably stronger. I’ve also gotten back into biking consistently, something I’ve always loved! Being in the Netherlands makes it easy to ride everywhere, and on weekends I’ll go out for long rides. Sometimes solo, sometimes with friends.</p><p>Biking has become more social, which I really enjoy. I even convinced one of my friends to get into it. Riding together has become a fun way to hang out. It’s not just about the workout or clearing my head anymore, it’s also about spending time with people I enjoy. That said, I still love my solo rides. There’s something about being on the road alone, with space to think (or not think at all), that really helps me reset.</p><p>One of the recent highlights was a 152km ride. It was my longest in a while, and I finished feeling strong. If I had fueled better, I’m pretty sure I could’ve gone another 50. That kind of ride is a reminder that progress isn’t just a feeling, it’s something you can see and measure. I’ve got a couple longer rides I want to do soon — Rotterdam to Ghent (~160km) and Rotterdam to Groningen (~265km). They’re not about proving anything to anyone else. They’re just quiet benchmarks to see how far I’ve come.</p><p>These past few months, I’ve also started ending my days with nighttime walks. They’ve become one of my favorite parts of the day — a time to reflect, unwind, and take stock of where I’m at. Sometimes I go alone, other times I’ll have a friend join me and we’ll just talk about whatever’s on our minds. It’s simple, but it’s helped me stay more in tune with myself.</p><p>There’s still more I want to do. I’d like to get more comfortable with running again, keep building strength, maybe add new challenges along the way. But I’m not rushing anything. I’m enjoying how this all fits into my life now, without forcing it.</p><p>The shift didn’t come from turning 26 — that was just a marker I used to get started. What’s kept me going is seeing progress, feeling better in my own body, and actually enjoying the process. I’m not chasing some perfect version of myself. I’m just getting closer to the person I’ve always wanted to be. And for now, that feels like more than enough!</p></article></main><footer class="max-w-screen-md mx-auto mt-12 px-4 mb-4"><div class="border-t border-gray-800 pt-4"><div class="flex justify-around space-x-20 mb-5 text-gray-600 text-sm font-medium"><a href=/travels class=hover:underline title="Travel Log">Travel Log</a>
