Right now, I’m in a place I genuinely love. Things feel aligned. I feel grounded. And even here, even at a point where I can honestly say I’m happy, I notice the choices I make still carry discomfort.</p><p>It’s funny, happiness doesn’t eliminate friction. It just makes it clearer. I see it for what it is. And I realize the only real choice is which discomfort I’m willing to carry.</p><p>I can choose the discomfort of risk - of putting myself forward, stepping into something uncertain, letting outcomes happen that I can’t fully control. It hits fast. Sharp. Immediate. And it teaches. It shows me what works, what doesn’t. It adds texture to life. Even if things don’t go perfectly, I gain clarity. I feel alive.</p><p>Or I can choose the discomfort of hesitation - holding back, wondering, replaying possibilities in my head. It feels safe, even comfortable at first. But it lingers. It doesn’t teach. It doesn’t move me. It just sits quietly, weighing more the longer I leave it alone.</p><p>I find myself drawn to the discomfort that moves me. The one that’s honest and present. The kind that sharpens my sense of self, stretches my understanding, and keeps life vivid. Moving feels better but that doesn’t mean I want to be reckless. I want edges, but edges with awareness.</p><p>Even in a place of happiness, I don’t want comfort to lull me into stasis. I want edges. I want clarity. I want growth. I want the kind of discomfort that makes life feel expansive rather than restrained.</p><p>And so I keep choosing it. Not because life is hard, not because I’m chasing challenge for its own sake, but because the friction of action, of engagement, of presence, adds to the life I already love. It amplifies it.</p><p>Happiness and growth aren’t opposites. They coexist. The discomfort I choose is part of that. It’s part of why life feels alive, why the present feels rich, why I can trust myself to navigate what comes next.</p><p>And that feels like the best kind of discomfort there is.</p></article></main><footer class="max-w-screen-md mx-auto mt-12 px-4 mb-4"><div class="border-t border-gray-800 pt-4"><div class="flex justify-around space-x-20 mb-5 text-gray-600 text-sm font-medium"><a href=/travels class=hover:underline title="Travel Log">Travel Log</a>
