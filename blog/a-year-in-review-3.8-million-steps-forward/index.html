Work, health, mindset, relationships. Looking back at them now, there’s a clear thread running through all of it.</p><p>If I had to name this year, I’d call it a year of consistency and growth.</p><p>For most of my life, I was good at starting things but struggled to see them through. That gap quietly bothered me, especially when it came to taking care of myself. This year, something changed. Not through motivation or intensity, but through showing up repeatedly and trusting the process.</p><p>Consistency became a form of self-respect. A way of trusting myself.</p><h2 id=rebuilding-from-an-unsteady-start>Rebuilding from an unsteady start</h2><p>The year didn’t begin on a high note. I started it feeling mentally off balance, unsure if I was doing enough and uncertain about direction. I carried a quiet pressure about where I should be.</p><p>What turned things around wasn’t a single breakthrough, but momentum built slowly. Small routines. Repeated effort. Less planning, more follow-through.</p><p>Fitness became the anchor!</p><p>With regular gym training and the help of a personal trainer, consistency finally stuck. Having that structure, and someone pushing me beyond comfort zones I would have settled into on my own, made a real difference. Not just physically, but mentally as well. Viktoriia played a big role in that. Her coaching helped me trust discipline over motivation.</p><p>I lost weight, built muscle, and grew more comfortable in my body. The mental health benefits mattered just as much as the physical ones.</p><p><img src=/review_2025/gym.png alt="picture in the gym"></p><h2 id=falling-back-in-love-with-biking>Falling back in love with biking</h2><p>This year, I rediscovered how much I love biking. After deciding to take it seriously, I rode around 4,000 km, and it quickly became more than just exercise.</p><p>Biking gives me calm. It’s where my thoughts slow down and sort themselves out.</p><p>Some rides stand out. Being challenged into a 150 km ride when I had only asked for a 100 km route and finishing it. Long rides through Belgium, including a memorable one from Ghent to Knokke. Catching the beginning of the Tour de France in Lille. Chasing sunrises and sunsets again, simply for the joy of it.</p><p>Biking also became social in the best way. Shared effort, long conversations, and quiet stretches where nothing needed to be said.</p><p>A big part of that was riding with Florian, who pushed me not just on the bike but in how I approached the year overall. What started with bikes gradually spilled into other parts of life. Having someone around who shares similar values and a desire to keep improving made this year feel less solitary and more grounded.</p><p>I only started riding consistently in June, and I spent large parts of September and October away from home. Knowing that makes this year feel even more encouraging. Next year, my goal is to ride 7,000 km. Not as a stretch for the sake of it, but as a continuation of something that has already become part of who I am. I would also love to take a biking vacation sometime next year.</p><p><img src=/review_2025/cycling.png alt="Bikng with friends"></p><h2 id=presence-not-just-progress>Presence, not just progress</h2><p>Somewhere along the way, I started living more in the moment.</p><p>I still care about goals, but I’m no longer always chasing the next one at the expense of the present. I find joy now in simple things. Running in the rain. A really good pastry with coffee. Quiet mornings. Being outside whenever I can.</p><p>I’ve intentionally spent less time on tech outside of work and more time grounded in the real world. That shift alone has made life feel lighter and more balanced.</p><p>Some of the most memorable moments this year were the smallest ones. Discovering a love for really good pastries and coffee. Sitting somewhere warm on a slow morning. Chasing sunrises and sunsets without a plan. These moments grounded me in the present and reminded me that joy doesn’t always come from milestones. Sometimes it’s already there if I’m paying attention.</p><p><img src=/review_2025/small_things.png alt="collage of pictures"></p><h2 id=work-balance-and-momentum>Work, balance, and momentum</h2><p>Professionally, this was a strong year.</p><p>I gave two conference talks, something I had wanted to do for a long time. Not everything went perfectly, including broken demos, but that was never the point. It was a start, and it gave me confidence. I want to do more of this going forward.</p><p>The startup I work for was acquired, and I was promoted to Senior Software Engineer. I’m genuinely enjoying my work and curious about what the next year holds.</p><p>Just as importantly, I’ve improved my work-life balance. I’m more intentional about how I spend my time and better at stepping away when needed. Enjoying my work while still having space for life outside of it has made a meaningful difference.</p><h2 id=reading-and-perspective>Reading and perspective</h2><p>I read around 20 books this year. The Book of Why and Clear Thinking stood out for how they shaped the way I think.</p><p>Reading, for me, is about expanding perspective. I started strong, slowed down later, and want to be more intentional about it again next year.</p><h2 id=relationships-boundaries-and-growing-up>Relationships, boundaries, and growing up</h2><p>Some relationships deepened this year, built on shared values, mutual effort, and a genuine desire to keep improving. Others faded, and I learned that it’s okay to let go when the effort becomes unidirectional.</p><p>I’ve become better at setting boundaries and kinder to myself because of it.</p><p>I also changed how I socialize at home. I still enjoy spending time in larger groups, but when it comes to dinners, I started hosting smaller ones more often. I invite one or two people over and cook together. It’s easier on my social battery, simpler logistically, and more meaningful. In many ways, it feels like a quiet step into being a more grounded adult.</p><p>I express gratitude more often now, and I feel more confident talking to people. Next year, I want to keep meeting new people, expanding my circle, and building meaningful connections.</p><h2 id=travel-independence-and-roots>Travel, independence, and roots</h2><p>I took a short solo trip to Copenhagen on a whim and spent a few days on my own. It reminded me how much I enjoy solo travel, something I used to do more and want to return to.</p><p>I also traveled with close friends and coworkers, each trip meaningful in its own way. Each of those trips helped me builder a closer bond to the people that I travelled with.</p><p>One of the most special moments this year was visiting India to surprise my mom for her 50th birthday. I hadn’t been back in a couple of years, and the trip made me reflect on how living in three different countries has shaped me. There are cultural clashes I’m still figuring out, and I’m okay letting that unfold slowly.</p><h2 id=closing-the-year-with-gratitude>Closing the year with gratitude</h2><p>Next year, I want to continue, not restart.</p><p>I want to stay consistent. With the gym. With running, with the goal of a half marathon on my birthday. With writing. With how I show up for people. I want to keep living in the moment, educate myself financially, build relationships, and explore new activities.</p><p>Most of all, I’m grateful. For my health, for consistency, and for the people in my life who showed up for me, supported me, challenged me, and shared parts of this year with me, even when they didn’t realize the impact they were having.</p><p>According to my Garmin, I took 3.8 million steps this year. Not all of them were deliberate. Some were hesitant, some confident, some taken on days when motivation was low. Taken together, they moved me forward quietly and consistently, one step at a time.</p><p>I’m grateful for quiet mornings, long rides, meaningful conversations, and a year that reminded me I can trust myself.</p><p>This has been one of the best years of my life. Not because it was perfect, but because I kept stepping forward.</p><p>And that feels like the right place to continue from!</p></article></main><footer class="max-w-screen-md mx-auto mt-12 px-4 mb-4"><div class="border-t border-gray-800 pt-4"><div class="flex justify-around space-x-20 mb-5 text-gray-600 text-sm font-medium"><a href=/travels class=hover:underline title="Travel Log">Travel Log</a>
